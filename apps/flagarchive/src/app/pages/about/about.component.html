<h3>A Historical Flag Database</h3>
<p>
  Flag Archive is a comprehensive online database dedicated to the visual history of flags from
  around the world. The mission is to preserve, document, and share the stories behind national,
  regional, and historical flags, making them accessible to anyone interested in vexillology,
  design, or global history.
</p>
<h3>What is Flag Archive?</h3>
<p>
  Flag Archive is a digital archive where users can explore flags by country, time period, region,
  or political status. Whether you're searching for a defunct empire's banner, a colonial-era
  variant, or a current national flag, this platform offers flag images and detailed background
  information for each entry.

<h3>Why Flag History Matters</h3>
<p>
  Flags are more than just designs &mdash; they are symbols of identity, sovereignty, resistance,
  and change. Studying historical flags helps us understand the evolution of nations, political
  movements, and cultural shifts. At Flag Archive, the aim is to make this data available to all
  enthusiasts worldwide.
